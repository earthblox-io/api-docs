### Saving a project as API endpoint



1. In Project Page click "Save"
2. In the "Save Project" form, enter a project name and "Others in my organisation can view" (edit option is fine too)
3. In the "Save" dropdown list select "API Access" and switch toggle to ON to enable API for the project
4. Using API, check that the saved project is now visible:

```
ebx.list_projects()
```
